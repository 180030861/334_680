	Pet-care is helpful for people who travel, or who are in need of a pet carertaker. This industry has been evolving recently.
	There are many pet-care centers available out there, but there are few limitations. The existing pet-care centers do not have a 
mobile application or a website to register the users and their pets. Though there are many websites out there, they only care for
the pets on a daily basis.
	Our contribution in this project is designing a interface for these pet-care centers using UI/UX methodologies. The design is
a collection of Personas, CJMs, Empathy Map, User Flow Diagram, Low-Fidelity design and High-Fidelity design. The personas include 
various roles in this project like the HR, manager etc. CJM explains the user's visualization of the product/design. Empathy map is 
used by the designers to know about the users. User Flow diagram is the descrition of user's flow while using the application.
In Lo-Fi design we create the visuals. In Hi-Fi design we go with the evaluation of the design.
	Hence this application is useful for the users to register and access the pet-care center(Pet-Factor).
